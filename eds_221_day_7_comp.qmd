```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(lubridate)
library(kableExtra)
```

### Part 1: Data wrangling refresher 

```{r}
my_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  filter(island %in% c("Biscoe","Dream")) %>%
  select(-year, -sex) %>%
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000) %>%
  rename(location = island)
  
```

### Part 2: Joins

```{r}
animals <- tibble::tribble(
             ~location,   ~species,  ~maturity,
              "lagoon",   "bobcat",    "adult",
               "bluff",   "coyote", "juvenile",
               "creek",      "fox",    "adult",
                "oaks", "squirrel", "juvenile",
               "bluff",   "bobcat",    "adult"
             )
sites <- tibble::tribble(
           ~location,      ~full_site_name, ~jurisdiction,
             "beach",       "Goleta Beach",     "SB City",
            "lagoon",        "UCSB Lagoon",        "UCSB",
             "bluff",       "Ellwood Mesa",     "SB City",
              "oaks", "Fremont Campground",        "USFS"
           )

```

#### Full Join

```{r}
full_join_example <- full_join(animals, sites, by = "location") 
```

#### Left Join

```{r}
left_join_example <- left_join(animals, sites, by = "location") 
```

#### Inner Join

```{r}
inner_join_example <- inner_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

Joining when key variables have non-matching names

```{r}
sites_2 <- sites %>%
  rename(loc = location)
nonmatch_example <- full_join(animals, sites_2, by = c("location" = "loc"))
```

#### Semi Join

```{r}
semi_join_example <- semi_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

#### Anti Join

```{r}
anti_join_example <- anti_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```
